Kate Baldwin is an emerging Lighting Designer.

She developed a passion for the arts at a young age when she started ballet classes in order to learn how to not trip over and hurt herself every day. After learning how to walk like a normal person (mostly), she decided to pursue a career in Theatre.

In 2019, she had the privilege of being a Lighting Designer on <Link to="/houseatboundaryroadliverpool">House on Boundary Road, Liverpool </Link>
(directed by Jess Arthur) at the Old 505 Theatre, completed a Lighting Design Secondment with Paul Jackson on Beauty Queen of Leenane (directed by Paige Rattray), and Lighting Designing for <Link to="/bluechristmas">Blue Christmas </Link> - a double bill at Kings Cross Theatre with the Ignite Collective and New Ghosts Theatre Company - directed by Lucy Clements.

Kate seconded with Verity Hampson on Double Delicious (CAAP and Sydney Festival) directed by Darren Yap and with Martin Kinnane on Night Parade of One Hundred Goblins (Clockfire Theatre Company and Sydney Festival) to kick off 2020. She is currently Lighting Designing for girl friend for Belvoir 25A.

She has now completed her Technical Theatre BFA at NIDA and is excited to continue working on new Australian work this year - she is Lighting Designing Yellow Face (KXT), Disparate Dreams for Millennial Dreams (KXT), and One Hour No Oil (Belvoir's 25A) later in the year.
